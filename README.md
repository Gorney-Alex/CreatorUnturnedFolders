Introduction

While working with Unturned mods in Unity, I often needed to create a large number of folders for the game. To simplify this process, I wrote a Unity script that automates and speeds up folder creation and file copying.

That’s it — the script will automatically create the necessary folders and copy files to the destination you specify.
